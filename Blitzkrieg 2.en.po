Easy to move and fast to traverse, they are ready to face the enemy anywhere they go. Digging in gives the guns further protection that it needs to withstand the pounding that their mighty adversaries may deliver. The lack of any fortification may leave the guns exposed to the attacks of fast moving armor units or close contact with enemy infantry."

They are not very good at attacking moving targets and should not be wasted this way. The only units that can reach bomber planes high in the sky are the heavy AA guns on the ground and fighter planes in the air. They take a heavy toll since bombers are virtually defenseless against them."

"Called by some the God of War, long range artillery is famous for giving the enemy hell on earth, while staying miles away in complete safety. There is nothing more breathtaking then a artillery battery delivering its devastating blow on the unsuspecting enemy positions. It's been a commonplace tactic to begin any major offensive with thorough artillery preparation. Their great range puts the guns well back from contact with the enemy's main forces, but an occasional raider, a surprise air strike or retaliation from the enemy's own long-range guns are the greatest hazards your artillery may face."

They combine a lower speed and reduced maneuverability than that of the figher planes with a smaller weapon load then that of bombers. Inferior to the specialized aircraft, GAPs never-the-less excel in destroying ground targets. They locate the enemy unit from high above, chase it across the field, dive onto the target with a mighty blow and escape into the blue leaving the enemy with a minimal chance to retaliate. The only two threats that can break this pattern are enemy AA Guns and fighter planes. Avoiding these dangers and concentrating on the relatively defenseless ground troops is the winning tactic for these air warriors."

The combination of the powerful weapon and massive armor makes heavy tanks indispensible when attacking all but the most heavily fortified enemy positions. As one of these magnificent machines rolls across the terrain you may occasionally hear a shell ricocheting off of its front armor. However, slow movement makes them an easy target for specialized anti-tank artillery that can eventually penetrate the tanks' heavy frontal armor so head-on attack against such guns may not be a good idea."

"Designed to fire along a very steep trajectory, these guns are ideal for combating air targets. Light AA guns can not reach high flying bombers, but fighter and ground attack planes easily fall prey to their rapid fire. When the skies are clear from the targets, these guns make an exceptional weapon against infantry. The rapid barrage of high explosive shells exploding in the middle of enemy formation quickly reduces their numbers. Lacking even rudimentary protection, these guns are very vulnerable to ground units and must be protected from this threat."

Infantry has the unique function of being able to actually occupy territory structures. They man postions in foxholes and turn buildings into tough obstacles when fighting in the cities. A strategic location is not fully taken until the last enemy soldier has been removed. The tanks may be the ultimate attack weapon, but the infantryman with some grenades or satchel charges will always be a most respected foe."

"Tank Destroyers\n"
"Partly tanks, partly artillery, these weapons specifically designed to fight the king of the modern battlefield - armor. With some armor themselves they have enough protection to go out and fight enemy tanks in the field. At the expense some mobility, they obtained the power to penetrate the defenses of the most advanced tanks and do so right where the enemy tank lurk, chasing and destroying them in spectacular armor clashes. When outnumbered, tank destroyers can take a more defensive stance and make a rather deadly obstacle in the enemy's path."

Your assignment is to lead the way across the river quickly using one of the three bridges in this area, and then establish strong points with your tanks that will prevent the enemy from further crossings.  A high speed of movement will be essential to your success here near the river.  Our armies are advancing across the map and the victory can not be far off now!\n"

"Our hard work in laying siege to Tobruk is finally being rewarded, and the Allied garrison is ready to fall.  We want you to lead the victorious liberation, but there are a few preliminary steps that must be accomplished before your final push.  Your mission will require attacking the fortifications around the Western fort, penetrating, and capturing the fort.  After removing the nearby entrenched British armor, you will be able to take control of the civilian areas of Tobruk, and then force the garrison to surrender.\n"

Once the factories are under control, you may lead the attack against the military headquarters.\n"

In May, 1941 41st, 54th, 64th and 91st RAF squadrons have been equipped with these machines, and only after the first combat flights of the aircraft was it presented to the public. The Spitfire V was better than its main competitor the Bf-109F in terms of speed and maneuverability at high altitude."

A flamethrower nose-piece was installed in place of the cannon and a container with liquid incendiary mix was placed in the turret. The flamethrower was pneumatic; the pause between bursts was at least 20 seconds. This modification of the Matilda was used in New Guinea and proved to be quite efficient against the entrenched Japanese."

"When the war began, the British began designing a next-generation infantry support tank.  Previous designs had emphasized the ability to focus maximum firepower in all directions, leading to multi-turreted monsters with only moderate armor protection.  This new tank was meant to have heavier armor and therefore the weaponry had to be scaled down.  \n"
"\n"
"The initial design was a classic interpretation of the tanks from the First World War; no turret, with weapons placed in side ports and tracks that encompassed the entire body.  The military quickly rejected the design and the anti-personnel gun was moved to a frontal panel and the anti-tank cannon was moved to turret.  Further redesign saw the front panel gun removed.\n"
"\n"
"Because of the urgent need, the tank was rushed into mass production.  It was named the Churchill, in honor of the British Prime Minister, who later quipped, “This tank has even more faults than myself\".  Indeed it did, slow speed, short range and a weak cannon were all limitations of the tank.  To add insult to injury it was so unreliable and complex that some inexperienced crews were unable to get it moving at all.  The tracks reached so far ahead of the tank that the driver could only see forward, and the dust that its treads kicked up obscured even that narrow field of vision further.  \n"
"\n"
"The Churchill did have at least one overwhelming strength, its thick armor, which was initially 102 mm and later increased to 152 mm.  This protection allowed it to withstand fire from practically any anti-tank weapon.  The British infantry valued the support provided by the Churchill highly and in the end, the tank that was obsolete even before it was made fought rather successfully until the very end of the war.  Due to its powerful armor the Churchill became the base for many modifications including a flamethrower tank and a bridge builder.  \n"

"An AA SPG; automatic AA cannon mounted on the chassis of the obsolete Crusader cruiser tank. The design work started in 1941, and in 1943 Morris Motors company began mass production of the SPG. Three modifications were manufactured: equipped with 40 mm Bofors cannon (AAI, 215 units made); with coupled 20 mm Erlicon cannons (AAII, 600 units made). The AA SPG's main drawback was inability to fire on the move."

"Французский легкий пехотный танк. Небольшую машину можно было быстро перебрасывать в кузове грузовика, что повышало ее оперативные возможности. На поле боя сравнительно хорошая защищенность не искупала слабого вооружения, малой скорости хода и неудобства управления. Тем не менее машина принимала широкое участие в войне по обе стороны фронта в Польше, Норвегии, Франции, на Ближнем Востоке и даже в СССР в составе румынской армии. В Румынии танк получил советскую 45-мм пушку из трофейных запасов, что несколько повысило его возможности."

"In 1940 the US military decided that they needed a small passenger vehicle to fulfill a number of tasks including communications, reconnaissance, towing artillery and other loads and transporting commanders.  What they wanted was something between a motorcycle with a side- car and an automobile.  Although the army asked 135 different American automobile manufacturers to submit bids for the project, only three companies came close to fulfilling the specifications, Bantam, Willys-Overland and Ford.  Although Bantam's model was first chosen, after heavy testing, Willys eventually won out, largely due to a more powerful engine.  In order to meet production Ford was eventually given a contact to manufacture the vehicle also, based on the Willy's design.  The Ford was named the GPW - many people incorrectly assume that the GP means General Purpose - in fact it meant Government, 80\" wheelbase with the W designating that it was a Willy's design.  The GP however did spawn the famous \"Jeep\" name.  This new jeep was easy to manufacture, easy to maintain and had excellent off-road capabilities, and so met the army's specifications perfectly.  \n"
"\n"
"The jeep literally became a legend.  Britain, Russia and other Allied countries received tens of thousands of these vehicles and it served on every front of the war.  The Axis powers didn't have such a versatile vehicle in service, which even led the Italians to offer twice as much money for a captured jeep than they did for a captured tank!\n"
"\n"
"In all, almost 660,000 jeeps were manufactured during the war years.  It served as a model for many imitations and even direct copying after the war and many of its initial design elements are still being used today.\n"

It wasn't uncommon for the ground attack aircraft's pilots to be awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union order after just 10 successful combat flights (normally it was awarded after 100 flights). Some desperate Soviet pilots attached wooden sticks at the back of the cockpit enclosure, so the aircraft would have at least some protection. The new version had a section to accommodate a gunner with UBT machinegun. On October 30, 1942 the two-seater IL2 started combat operations, and was quite successful."

"Produced since 1934 at the Marti factory in Nikolayev. The design included 180 mm B1P naval gun mounted on armoured eight-axis railway platform. There were 4 such cannons in a battery. By June 22, 1941 there were only four such batteries in the Red Army: one each in Tallinn, in Hanko peninsula, under Libava (the whole Baltic fleet) and in the Novorossiysk area (the Black Sea fleet)."

"Railway artillery mounts were used for significant reinforcement of the coastal fortifications, as they allowed to concentrate tremendous fire power on the selected part of the coast line. One of such mounts was the Soviet TM-2-12. Since the Germans did not strike any severe blows from the seaside, these mounts were used for counter-battery fire and destroying the stronger fortifications, because the 470 kilo shell was large enough to destroy any target. The TM-2-12 was able to fire all-round only from the special grounds, so the angle of fire was restricted to 5 degrees."

"A \"V-2\" was the first ballistic missile, adopted in the world. It was designed by the German engineers in the framework of \"super-weapon\"  development. A \"V-2\" was used mostly for bombardment of London. It turned out to be absolutely impossible to intercept the missile. There was no defense from it. But the absence of the specialized parts, low accuracy and high price (a V-2 cost as much as 5 fighters) did not allow it to greatly influence greatly on the course of the war.The \"V-2\" was used as a basis for the development of the post-war ballistic missiles in the USA, the USSR, Great Britain and France."

"German front-line dive-bomber of the WW2. The aircraft was highly efficient until challenged by the opposition. Its accuracy against ground targets was exceptional (no more than 25 m deviation from the targeting point). Extremely vulnerable without fighter escort. About 5,700 such aircraft were made altogether, in four modifications: Ju87B1, Ju87B2, Ju87D and Ju87G."
